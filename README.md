# FUTURE_CS_01 – Vulnerability Assessment Report

## Internship Track
Cyber Security – Future Interns

## Task Objective
The objective of this task was to perform a basic vulnerability assessment on a publicly accessible web application using ethical and non-intrusive techniques, and document the findings in a professional security report.

## Scope of Work
- Basic network port analysis (reference-based)
- HTTP and HTTPS accessibility check
- Security header inspection
- Cookie security flag review
- No exploitation or active attacks performed

## Tools Used
- Nmap (reference-based scan)
- Browser Developer Tools (Chrome)
- Manual browser inspection

## Key Observations
- Ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) were observed open
- HTTPS encryption was enabled
- HTTP access was available without forced redirection
- Common HTTP security headers were missing
- Cookies were observed with Secure and HttpOnly flags enabled

## Deliverables
- A detailed Vulnerability Assessment Report documenting identified risks and recommendations
- Screenshots serving as evidence of the analysis

## Ethical Disclaimer
This assessment was conducted strictly for educational purposes as part of the Future Interns Cyber Security internship. Only passive and non-intrusive techniques were used.
